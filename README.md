# Travelling-Salesman-Genetic-Algorithm

Travelling Salesman is an NP-Hard problem, where the task is to find the shortest path to visit each city with known distances between them and to return to the original city. This specific algorithm utilizes the genetic algorithm approach, which is an AI based methodolgy that takes inspiration from the real world Darwinian theory of natural evolution to tackle complex tasks, such as the Travelling Salesman Problem.

This specific algorithm does not guarantee the most optimal solution in each run, however it is very efficient at approximating the optimal solution with minimal iteration steps.
